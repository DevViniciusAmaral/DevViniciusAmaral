## 🙋‍♂️ Hello World!

Nice to meet you!

My name is Vinicius, I've been developing websites with <strong>React</strong> technology and apps for Android and iOS with <strong>React Native</strong> technology for over 3 years, with experience in large companies and freelance projects.

I've participated in projects from the beginning, where we designed the entire structure and standards we would use to have better performance and delivery for the client, as well as working on legacy projects, needing to maintain, update and add new features.
